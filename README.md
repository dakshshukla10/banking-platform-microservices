# 🏦 Banking Platform Microservices

A comprehensive, production-ready banking platform built with modern microservices architecture, demonstrating enterprise-grade patterns for financial transaction processing, security, and real-time data streaming.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This platform showcases a complete banking ecosystem with distributed services, event-driven architecture, and cloud-native deployment strategies. Built for scalability, security, and maintainability - the same patterns used by major financial institutions.

**Key Features:**
- 🔐 **JWT-based Authentication** - Secure user authentication and authorization
- ⚡ **Real-time Transaction Processing** - Event-driven transaction pipeline
- 📊 **Live Dashboard** - React-based real-time monitoring interface
- 🔄 **Event Streaming** - Apache Kafka for reliable message processing
- 🐳 **Containerized Deployment** - Docker and Kubernetes ready
- 📈 **Observability** - Comprehensive monitoring and logging

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Microservices Components

| Service | Technology | Purpose | Status |
|---------|------------|---------|--------|
| **Auth Service** | Spring Boot 3, JWT, PostgreSQL | User authentication & authorization | 🟡 In Progress |
| **Transaction Producer** | Spring Boot 3, Kafka | REST API for transaction ingestion | 🔄 Planned |
| **Transaction Consumer** | Spring Boot 3, JPA | Event processing & data persistence | 🔄 Planned |
| **UI Dashboard** | React, TypeScript | Real-time transaction monitoring | 🔄 Planned |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker, Kubernetes, Helm | Deployment & orchestration | 🔄 Planned |

### Technology Stack

**Backend Services:**
- Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.5.3
- Spring Security + JWT Authentication
- Spring Data JPA + PostgreSQL
- Apache Kafka for event streaming
- Maven for dependency management

**Frontend:**
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Modern UI with real-time updates
- Responsive design

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Kubernetes + Helm charts
- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

**Development:**
- H2 for testing
- Testcontainers for integration tests
- SonarQube for code quality

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 21+
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[username]/banking-platform-microservices.git
cd banking-platform-microservices

# Start infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d postgres kafka zookeeper

# Run authentication service
cd auth-service
mvn spring-boot:run

# Access the application
# Auth Service: http://localhost:8081
# API Docs: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run integration tests
mvn verify -P integration-tests

# Run specific service tests
cd auth-service && mvn test
```

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests with JUnit 5
- Integration tests with Testcontainers
- Contract testing with Spring Cloud Contract
- End-to-end testing with Selenium

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

- **Health Checks**: `/actuator/health` endpoints
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics at `/actuator/prometheus`
- **Distributed Tracing**: Sleuth + Zipkin integration
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- **Dashboards**: Grafana dashboards for system monitoring

## 🔒 Security Features

- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting
- Input validation & sanitization
- Secure configuration management
- HTTPS/TLS encryption

## 🐳 Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes
```bash
helm install banking-platform ./helm-charts/
```

### Production Considerations
- Multi-environment configuration
- Secret management with Kubernetes secrets
- Auto-scaling policies
- Backup and disaster recovery
