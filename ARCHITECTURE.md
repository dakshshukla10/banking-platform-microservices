# üèóÔ∏è Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The Banking Platform Microservices is designed as a distributed system following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and microservices architecture patterns.

## üéØ Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate through well-defined APIs
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped together
- **Fault Tolerance**: Services handle failures gracefully
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities built-in

## üèõÔ∏è Service Architecture

### Auth Service
**Purpose**: User authentication and authorization
- JWT token generation and validation
- User registration and login
- Role-based access control
- Password security and validation

**Technology Stack**:
- Spring Boot 3.5.3
- Spring Security
- JWT (JJWT library)
- PostgreSQL
- Maven

### Transaction Producer
**Purpose**: Transaction ingestion and event publishing
- REST API for transaction requests
- Input validation and sanitization
- Event publishing to Kafka
- Rate limiting and throttling

### Transaction Consumer
**Purpose**: Event processing and data persistence
- Kafka event consumption
- Business logic processing
- Data persistence
- Event sourcing patterns

### UI Dashboard
**Purpose**: User interface and real-time monitoring
- React-based SPA
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Transaction visualization
- User management interface

## üîÑ Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- REST APIs for user-facing operations
- Service-to-service calls for immediate responses
- Health checks and monitoring

### Asynchronous Communication
- Kafka for event streaming
- Event-driven architecture
- Eventual consistency patterns

## üìä Data Architecture

### Database Strategy
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data store for all services
- **Database per Service**: Each microservice owns its data
- **Event Sourcing**: Transaction history preservation
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation

### Data Flow
1. User submits transaction via UI
2. Auth service validates user token
3. Transaction producer validates and publishes event
4. Transaction consumer processes and stores data
5. UI receives real-time updates

## üîí Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User login with credentials
2. Auth service validates and issues JWT
3. JWT included in subsequent requests
4. Services validate JWT for authorization

### Security Measures
- JWT token expiration and refresh
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- HTTPS/TLS encryption

## üöÄ Deployment Architecture

### Local Development
- Docker Compose for infrastructure
- Hot reloading for development
- H2 database for testing

### Production
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Helm charts for deployment
- Auto-scaling policies
- Load balancing

## üìà Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Custom business metrics

### Logging
- Structured JSON logging
- Correlation IDs for tracing
- Centralized log aggregation

### Health Monitoring
- Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
- Kubernetes health checks
- Circuit breaker patterns

## üîß Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: Feature development
- `hotfix/*`: Production fixes

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Code commit triggers build
2. Automated testing (unit, integration)
3. Code quality checks
4. Docker image creation
5. Deployment to staging
6. Manual approval for production

## üìö Technology Decisions

### Why Spring Boot?
- Mature ecosystem
- Production-ready features
- Excellent documentation
- Strong community support

### Why Kafka?
- High throughput message streaming
- Fault tolerance and durability

- Event sourcing capabilities

### Why PostgreSQL?
- ACID compliance for financial data
- JSON support for flexibility
- Excellent performance
- Strong consistency guarantees

### Why React?
- Component-based architecture
- Large ecosystem
- Real-time capabilities
- Modern development experience

## üîÆ Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Service mesh implementation (Istio)
- Database sharding strategies
- Caching layers (Redis)
- CDN for static assets

### Advanced Features
- Machine learning integration
- Advanced analytics
- Multi-region deployment
- Blockchain integration
